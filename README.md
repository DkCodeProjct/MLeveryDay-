:[] In this repo, I will add some facts about machine learning that I'm learning from the book I'm reading now, which
is "Statquest-Illustrated-Guide-to-Machine-Learning" </>

1 -> machine learing could be about 2 things//
            1) We can use it to classify things 
            2) we can use it to make quantitative predictions

2 -> 1. when we use ML to clasify things we called it "[ Classification ]"
     2. when we use ML to make some quantitative predictions, 
we call it "[ Regression ]"
