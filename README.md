# <h1>Machine Learning Facts Repository</h1>

<p>Welcome to my Machine Learning Facts repository! In this repository, I share key insights and facts about machine learning that I'm learning from the book "Statquest-Illustrated-Guide-to-Machine-Learning."</p>

## <h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Machine learning encompasses various concepts, but broadly, it can be about two main things:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Classification:</strong> Using ML to categorize and classify data.</li>
  <li><strong>Regression:</strong> Utilizing ML to make quantitative predictions.</li>
</ol>

## <h2>Key Points</h2>

### <h3>Classification</h3>

<p>When employing machine learning for classification, it involves categorizing data into different classes. This process is referred to as <strong>Classification</strong>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Classifying things with machine learning is known as <code>"[ Classification ]"</code>.</li>
  <li>The primary goal is to categorize data into predefined classes or groups.</li>
</ol>

### <h3>Regression</h3>

<p>Machine learning can also be used for making quantitative predictions. This aspect of ML is called <strong>Regression</strong>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Making quantitative predictions using ML is known as <code>"[ Regression ]"</code>.</li>
  <li>The focus is on predicting numerical values or quantities.</li>
</ol>
